# Three.js Journey Experiments

This repository contains a series of experiments and examples created as part of the "ThreeJS Journey" course taught by Bruno Simon. Each experiment is based on the concepts and techniques learned in different chapters of the course.

## Chapters and Experiments

### Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Three.js

In this chapter, you will acquire the fundamentals of Three.js. The goal is to understand how to create a basic scene and utilize the library to generate visual content.

**Experiment: Terrain Generation with Perlin Noise**
- Folder: `chapter-one-experiment`
- Description: In this experiment, a scene is created that generates terrain using the Perlin Noise algorithm. The terrain follows the aesthetic of Minecraft, and raycasting is implemented to allow the user to walk on the generated terrain.

### Chapter 2: Lighting, Particles, and Textures

This chapter focuses on applying lighting to scenes, as well as using textures and particles to enhance the visual quality of objects.

**Experiment: Scene with Advanced Lighting and Textures**
- Folder: `chapter-two-experiment`
- Description: In this experiment, a scene is created that utilizes advanced lighting techniques to highlight objects in the scene. Various types of textures, such as displacement and normals, are applied to play with vertices and objects.

### Chapter 3: Advanced Techniques


**Experiment: First Person Shooter Sandbox with Physics**
- Folder: `chapter-three-experiment`
- Description: In this experiment, an object-oriented approach is implemented to create a first person shooter camera and sandbox. Classes and inheritance are used to structure the code in a more organized manner. Additionally, physics are integrated using the Cannon-es library to simulate movement and interactions of objects in the scene.

## How to Use the Experiments

Each experiment folder contains its own source code and necessary files to run the corresponding experiment. To run an experiment in your own environment, follow the instructions located in the folder of each experiment.

1. Navigate to the experiment's folder: `cd chapter-one-experiment`
2. Install dependencies: `npm i`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
